## Features
### Custom profiles

The hub allows you to use and modify up to three profiles. Each of them has a different background and an personalized widget layout.

  

### 10 backgrounds

The ten default backgrounds in the hub are split in 2 groups. *Nature* and *abstract*. You can cycle between the wallpapers by clicking the button on the top left.

You can also randomly choose a background with the button on its right.

  

### Widgets

The hub gives you three rows where you can put widgets. On the bottom left you can put big widgets, and after the big widgets medium and small ones, the small widgets being above the medium widgets.

You can choose from following of the included widgets:

#### Digital clock

Available sizes: **medium, small**

Shows the time.

  

#### Analog clock

Available sizes: **big, small**
Just simply shows an analog clock with hour minute and second hands.

  

#### Date

Available sizes: **medium, small**
Shows the current month, year, day and weekday. The small version only shows the day.

  

#### Shellshockers

Available sizes: **medium**
Shows a textbox where you can enter a shellshockers code and after pressing enter, you are automatically redirected to the given lobby.
*Useless but fun*

  

#### ToDo-list

Available sizes: **big**
Enter the task you have to do in the textbox. Press enter to save it. After completing it, click the tick infront of the text. The text should turn green. After reloading the page, the text is gone.

  

#### Weather

Available sizes: **big, medium, small**

The weather widget fetches the weather from the open-meteo.com API.
The your device is localized via geolocation.
The weather is updated all 5 minutes, and the location every day.
For a visual indication of the weather, I created 29 icons for every weather code used by the API.
**Differences between sizes:**
||Big|Medium|Small
|--|--|--|--
|Icon|Yes|Yes|Yes
|Temperature in °C|Yes|Yes|No
|Felt temperature in °C|Yes|No|No

## What's to come
Here are some things I might add to the hub in the future:

 - Clock on the bottom right (Basically a combination of the clock and date widget)
 - Pinned websites (Pin your favourite websites on the right side of the screen)
 - Custom wallpapers (self-explanatory)
 - More widgets (Calendar, stopwatch and other utils)
 - Search bar (DuckDuckGo search bar in the center area)
 - Custom alerts (Define what has to change on a website, for example "The word 'SpaceX' has to appear", and every time you start the hub, it fetches the website and checks for it. An alert will be displayed if it does.)
 - Light/Dark mode and more themes
## Install instructions
Install "New Tab Redirect" from the Chrome Web Store (You will most certainly find alternatives for Firefox or other browsers)
To install, download the repository and extract it somewhere safe.
Open the "index.html" file you downloaded in your browser.
Copy the text in the adress bar and paste it in the New Tab Redirect settings page.
If you did everything correctly, The Hub should show up in a new tab.
